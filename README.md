This project is a command line implementation for ip filter.

1) Implemented Design Patterns

Factory, Strategy, Interpreter patterns are implemented in this project.

Factory is still in work-in-progress. Supposedly I can replace the container list with a fake list. But it is not done yet.

Interpreter allows users can add inputs such as "1.1.1.1 issues:DNS attack". 

Strategy makes it possible to use 3 different filtering: blacklist only, whitelist only, or both black and white list.


2) Implemented Java specific programming concepts

Java Generics and Stream are implemented


3) Implemented generic programming concepts

OOP, Polymorphism, TDD principles are implemented.

4) Features

This project can use both blacklist and whitelist.

Both lists accept wildcard entries. 

5) Todo list

If more time was allowed, a front end with Spring framework would have been added.
github action is not added yet.
